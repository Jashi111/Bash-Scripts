Overview
This Bash script updates specific values in two JSON configuration files used for IVR-related operations. The script allows you to update audio file paths for different languages (Sinhala, Tamil, and English) and change a specific mapping in the configuration. It also provides an option to revert the changes back to their original state.

JSON Files Modified
functions.config.json: Contains the configuration for the audio files in different languages.
functions.map.json: Contains a mapping related to the IVR functionality.
