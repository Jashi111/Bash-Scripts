Overview
This Bash script reorganizes folders from a source directory and copies them into a destination directory in a year-month-day format. The script works by iterating over month-based folders (from 01 to 12) and their corresponding day subfolders, then it copies them into a destination directory with the new format.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the correct permissions to access and modify the following directories:

Source directory: /opt/Folder
Destination directory: /opt/Reorder
You can modify the script if your source and destination directories are different.

Directory Structure
Source Directory Structure: The source directory is expected to have the following format:
/opt/Folder/
  ├── 01/
  │   ├── 01/
  │   ├── 02/
  │   └── ...
  ├── 02/
  └── ...
Each subdirectory inside the folders 01 to 12 should represent a day.

Destination Directory Structure: After running the script, the destination directory will have folders in the format year-month-day:
/opt/Reorder/
  ├── 2024-01-01/
  ├── 2024-01-02/
  └── ...
